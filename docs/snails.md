# Snails

Snails are the crux of the snailrace game, they are the entry point to the games
world. As an Role Playing Game (RPG), they need to feel like they belong and are
effected by things in the game. The snails in Snailrace must:

- Have their own breeds and how those breeds affect the stats and abilities
- Equip up to 5 items that modify the snails stats
- Breeding snails which combined the stats of the parent snail but still keep
  one of the parents breeds.
- Leveling and progressing, allowing the snail to improve its stats 
  progressively.

Each snail is built up of their own stats, which can be modified through breed,
equipment and leveling up. There are 4 main statistics that are used for racing,
each are in the range of `[1, 20]`:

- **Speed**: 
    This stat represents how fast the snail can go, its a relative value as the 
    snail's are limited to `5 units per step`.

- **Stamina**: 
    Stamina determines how long a snail can maintain its top speed before 
    getting fatigued.

- **Agility**: 
    Agility affects a snail's ability to navigate turns or obstacles on the 
    racecourse. Though there is no plans of adding obstacles to the racecourse,
    it can be seen as navigation through inperfections in the track.

- **Endurance**: 
    Endurance represents a snails's overall ability to withstand the rigors of 
    a race indicating how long a snail can race before becoming completely 
    exhausted.

The use of these stats can be used in the following function formula:

```go
stats := ... // Get Snail's Racing stats

// Initial Effective Speed
effective_speed := (5 * (stats.Speed / 20.0)) + rand.Float64()

// Calculate edurance factor and adjust the effective speed
endurance_factor := ((stats.Stamina + stats.Endurance) / 2.0) / 20.0
effective_speed *= endurance_factor

// Simulate agility by introducing a chance of losing speed
agility_chance := h.Agility / 20.0
if rand.Float64() < agility_chance {
    effective_speed *= 0.9 // Reduce speed by 10% if agility check fails
}

// Update Snail Position
position += effective_speed

```

Unlike the previous design of Starter, Amatuer, Expert snails. This spec acts 
more RPG like, where snails have a base stats and have a limited way to 
increase its stats. Snails can max out to **Level 5** at each level the snail
owner can increase a single stat. When the snails reach **Level 3, 4, 5** they
also get the option of selecting an **Ability** which are different for each
breed. These abilities modify the snail's stats futher and must be chosen 
selectively as the snail can only have **3 Abilities**.

Items are another way of increasing the stats of snails, these can be bought, 
found, traded or won. Items are ranked in tiers: `Common`, `Uncommon`, `Rare` 
and `Legendary`, each rank affect snails in a increasing order respectively and
also increase in difficulty to get. A snail can only hold **3 Items** at a time
and be equipped/dequipped between other snails. Each breed have a item 
requirement for breeding, which after breeding the item is destroyed.

## Snail Breeds

the base states for each breed of snails, a description of their appearance,
some lore, unlockable abilities, and the lore on the requirements to breed.
